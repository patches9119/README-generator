## Usage

Once you have successfully installed the package you will have access to two additional commands. "generatereadme" and
"generatecustom".

### Generate Readme
```sh
$ generatereadme
```
This is the default command that will auto fill in sections of a basic readme file with information from the package.json folder that is currently in the directory you are in. If no package.json folder is present the command will return an error. Make sure to run:
```sh
$ npm init
```
before trying to run this command.

### Generate Custom
```sh
$ generatecustom
```
This is a seperate command used if you want to get a head start on the readme and manually input a description, installation section etc. 

This is a list of the prompts that will appear.

>*Note that if you do want to input a manual table of contents that they will not come with a link embedded.

## Tests
 As an example, take this very basic package.json file.
 
 ```sh
{
  "name": "default-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.19.2",
    "inquirer": "^7.3.3"
  }
}
```

If you were to input the command:
```sh
$ generatereadme
```

The output would be:
```sh
# default-project
